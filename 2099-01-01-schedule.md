Below is a list of all topics and readings for this course. Keep in mind that
the schedule will be filled in and adjusted throughout the semester.  **This
schedule was last updated on March 26, 2020.**


### Course Introduction

#### Mar. 25, Monday (but really Wednesday)


Required reading and watching:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 


Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in CS2011, so hopefully you have a copy lying
around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd recommend reviewing
Chapter 3 to start.    

**Released challenges:**
 - All of the participation challenges (Deadline: May 11)


### The Basics of Buffer Overflows

#### Mar. 26, Thursday.

 - [Quick Notes: Introducing 64-bit Binaries.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/64bits.html)  
 - [Quick Notes: Intel vs. At&t syntax.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/intel_v_att.html)

variables---or just want to brush up a bit---take a look at the following
